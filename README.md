# WeatherAnalyzer

We created a program that allows a user to enter in an Excel file with different weather analytics and organize the data both numerically and graphically.
The user is provided with a menu in which they are able to select their desired set of data. 


HOW TO RUN:
  - Copy the GitHub Repository into your computer
  - Check to see if the Anaconda Python Environment is installed and selected
  - CD into the correct folder 
  - Select on main.py and compile and run the program
  - The program should run and menu should be displayed in the terminal
  - Enter a value from 1-11 where it states "Enter an option" and the desired data or graph should appear
